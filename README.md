# Thyroid-Disease-Prediction
- Thyroid disease is a major cause of formation in medical diagnosis and in the prediction, onset to which it is a difficult axiom in the medical research.
- Data cleansing techniques were applied to make the data primitive enough for performing analytics to show the risk of patients obtaining thyroid.
- The machine learning plays a decisive role in the process of disease prediction and this paper handles the analysis and classification models that are being used in the thyroid disease based on the information gathered from the dataset.
- Machine Learning Algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), K-NN etc were used to predict the estimated risk on a patient's chance of obtaining thyroid disease.
